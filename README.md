# skywatch-python-cli
Python based command line interface (CLI) wrapper for SkyWatch API

SkyWatch provides satellite imagery for analysis through their APIs. This Python CLI is a wrapper around their API calls for the "data" endpoint and the "values" endpoint.

Goal: the idea with this project is that you should be able to use this as a quick way to read & download the data that comes with SkyWatch API.
